# vending-machine

The Machine class is an interactive simulation of a vending machine, which prompts users multiple times to make various decicions regarding the machine.
My program keeps track of the user's balance, and allows the user to decide which items to choose from the vending machine based on their balance.
If the user would like to end use with the vending machine, the program terminates and relays a "refund" of the remaining balance.
